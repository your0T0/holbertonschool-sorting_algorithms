# Sorting Algorithms

This project is part of the Holberton School curriculum.
The goal of this project is to practice different sorting algorithms
and understand their time complexity using Big O notation.

## About the project

In this project, I implemented several sorting algorithms in C.
Some algorithms work on arrays, and others work on doubly linked lists.
After every swap, the array or list is printed to show how the algorithm works step by step.

Each algorithm also has a separate file that shows its time complexity
in the best, average, and worst cases.

## Implemented algorithms

- Bubble Sort
- Insertion Sort (Doubly Linked List)
- Selection Sort
- Quick Sort (Lomuto partition)

## Files

- sort.h : Header file with structures and function prototypes
- 0-bubble_sort.c : Bubble sort implementation
- 1-insertion_sort_list.c : Insertion sort for doubly linked lists 
- 2-selection_sort.c : Selection sort implementation 
- 3-quick_sort.c : Quick sort implementation 
- 0-O, 1-O, 2-O, 3-O : Big O notation files
